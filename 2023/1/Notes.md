# Each line of input is one number

# Combine the first digit and last digit to create a two-digit number

# Need to grep each string input for the first number and the last number, then combine them.

## Edge Cases: If there is only one number, do two of those. so we need to just use the 0 and nth values of the array even if they are the same.

## What do with the values in letter form?
